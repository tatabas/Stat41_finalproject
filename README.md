# Stat41_finalproject

Final Project for Stat41: Data Visualizations. The project looks through datasets obtained from Spotify, the World Happiness Report, and UN Office on Drugs and Crime to explore any correlation in world trends between music and crime or happiness. 

Much of the project preparation was devoted to data cleaning and preparation as outlined in `ATABAS_HUANG_dataCleaning.Rmd`. After the data was prepared, it was fairly easy to manipulate it and create some interesting plots.

The final report has a set of all of our plots and visualizations. In addition to that, there are also large sections of interpretation and commentary on the data and results.
