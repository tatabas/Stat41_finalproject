# Xaringan presentation

(Need to install the `xaringan` package)

+ [About](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html)
+ [Themes here](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/wiki/Themes)
+ Want to get fancy with a custom theme? Try [xaringan themer](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/articles/xaringanthemer.html)
+ Style edits: google "how to ______ in xaringan"

**Difference:** slides are broken up with `---`

# Including an image


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lter_penguins.png")
```

---
# Bullets

* **Bold** 
* *Italic* 
+ Can also use `+` instead of `*` to create the bullets 
    + use a double `tab` to get subbullets 

---
# Latex 

You can embed latex right into your slides, for example:

* Unweighted graph: $A_{i,j} \in \{0,1\}$ where 1 means there is an edge between nodes $i$ and $j$, and 0 means no edge.
* Weighted graph: perhaps $A_{i,j} \in [0,1]$  or $A_{i,j} \in [0,\infty)$ 
* Undirected graph: $A_{i,j} = A_{j,i}$. Directed graph: possible that $A_{i,j} \neq A_{j,i}$.

# R code

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=2, fig.width=2.5, fig.align='center'}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, col = species)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .7) + 
  theme_minimal(base_family = "serif") + # Custom fonts can be tricky with latex
  scale_color_viridis_d(option = "C", end = .75)
```

# Tables by hand

| Variable  | Description | 
| --------  |-------------------------------------------------| 
| species                 | species of penguin   |
| island                  | island where penguin lives |
| bill_length_mm          | bill length in mm |
| bill_depth_mm           | bill depth in mm |
| flipper_length_mm       | flipper length in mm |

# Tables with R output

```{r}
bill_mod = lm(bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm + species, 
              data = penguins)
tidy(bill_mod) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable()
```
